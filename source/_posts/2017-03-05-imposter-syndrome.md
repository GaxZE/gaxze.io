title: Impostor syndrome

---

Starting off in the big wide world after finishing my studies, I opted to head into the world of [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org). I say opted.. in reality it was more a chosen technology by my then employer and I was happy for the opportunity. At the time this was my first experience with Drupal 6 and I soon discovered there was a large learning curve to harness this software. The learning curve naturally invoked some long spells of frustration and disappointment. Naturally I was wrestling with it all and still being paid to produce a fairly difficult application for my employer. I needed time to make mistakes and learn from those mistakes. It's generally to this day still, how I work in web development. Although experience has taught me to approach tasks in a multitude of different ways. 

Anyways, to cut a long story short.. I was building, learning and making a complete hash of this project for my employer. The clock was ticking as deadlines needed to be met and it wasn't really heading in the right direction. Lucky for me in the extremely early stages of my career, my employer sought the help of an agency to not only try and take this project further, but to also take me along with it. This was the rough starting point for me to learn what exactly Impostor Syndrome actually was, yet not realise that it was even a thing that existed!

So whats impostor syndrome I hear you ask? Well [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome) tells us the following:

> Impostor syndrome (also known as impostor phenomenon or fraud syndrome) is a concept describing high-achieving individuals who are marked by an inability to internalize their accomplishments and a persistent fear of being exposed as a "fraud".

By nature I'm generally a negative person when it comes to my own self-achievements. I hate nothing more than being the centre of attention or being praised for anything. I find it a feeling similar to that of an awkward silence, generally I have to say something to stop the praise. I only found out about Impostor syndrome a few years ago and I suppose it's just a case of being able to 'label' a flaw in ones personality. But I believe there is some real substance to it. Developers, will throughout their career be subject to peer review, it's was actually makes us better developers. This brings me back to my original story, I left one company for an agency of Drupal experts. I was so apprehensive, I originally thought that I should just quit this job and find something else to do. The thought of going to work for an agency filled me with so much fear of being 'caught out'. 

The fear would stay with me whilst I progressed with Drupal, gaining more and more experience. I've worked with Drupal now for a good 6 years and even to this day when presenting my work to colleagues, I still get that fear. I immediately think "Oh no, what if I get this wrong, everybody is going to think I'm an impostor". I believe understanding this feeling can be turned into a strength of a person's mentality. The best developers who create the best applications and websites were once a "bad developer". 





I found out this weekend whilst at [Drupal camp London](https://drupalcamp.london)
