Starting off the big wide world after finishing my degree, I opted to start forging my career around <a href="https://www.drupal.org" target="_blank">Drupal</a>. I say opted.. the reality of it was that Drupal was a chosen technology by my then employer and I was happy for the opportunity. 

At the time, this was my first experience with Drupal and I soon discovered there was a large learning curve, in order to harness the true power of this software. The learning curve naturally invoked some long spells of frustration and disappointment. Naturally, I was trying to get to grips with everything and still being paid to produce a fairly difficult application, especially for my first gig as a web developer. I needed time to make mistakes and learn from those mistakes. 

So this leads me onto Imposter syndrome. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imposter_syndrome" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> details the following description of imposter syndrome:

> Imposter syndrome (also known as imposter phenomenon or fraud syndrome) is a concept describing high-achieving individuals who are marked by an inability to internalize their accomplishments and a persistent fear of being exposed as a "fraud". 

Imposter syndrome is something I've only recently discovered and read up on. There was many times where I would be going between jobs and I'd be thinking "am I good enough to work there?". This can also be recognised as a lack of self-confidence. But for me, I felt like a fraud going into each of my roles. With each job change, the pressure felt of being able to deliver was massive. I remember my first project at <a href="https://wwww.ndp-studio.com" target="_blank">New Digital Partnership</a>, I was given a Photoshop file, which I had to translate into a website. So the build went as expected. Very much a brochure site and no real problems. Then after completing the build it was my task to theme the site as per the designs. 

So there I am build going well and theming about to begin. I luckily had a very supportive experience whilst at NDP. There was no single-point blaming for any projects shortcomings or issues. Sadly, for my first project I managed to take a 960 grid and theme it to 890. Once I pushed this through to QA, people started to notice my mistake. It was then, I felt like a fraud and then when I felt as if I was going to be fired for not knowing what I was doing. But luckily for me, NDP and the management there swooped in and was on hand to fix the problem, whilst giving me valuable training at the same time.

The moment I realised the mistake was the most crucial part. The immediate swarm of emotion and panic came in and I felt like changing my career there and then. But that is the mentality of a developer(mine at least). You make mistakes everyday, this you can't really avoid. With technology evolving so much, its bound to happen. It's always about your reaction to those moments which will define if you're going to succeed.

It's quite funny looking back. To this day if some change of mine is found to be faulty, I immediately tell myself that everybody is going to think I'm a bad developer, I'm a fraud and I don't deserve my job. But the change I'm pushing live has gone through testing from other developers, a dedicated testing team and content managers. Success and failure for me is never defined by any single entity but that of a group effort. The team succeeds and fails together. That is for me, how it always should be.
